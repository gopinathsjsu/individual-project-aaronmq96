## Design patterns Used: 

1) Factory Pattern:

Description: A creational design pattern that allows subclasses to decide which object to be invoked. The invoked object is of the type parent interface.
Pattern usage: This pattern is used in the project to write the output file or error file based on the availability if items in inventory.

2) Singleton Pattern:

Description: Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.
